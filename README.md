# emulator

Seems to be working ðŸ˜‚

Quick way to create an Android Emulator without Android Studio and without trying to remember sdkmanager & avdmanager commands (not that it's hard)

## build the project
```bash
go build
```

## run the build file
```bash
./emulator
```

## issues
Well if you have any issues, feel free to fix the code and maybe (just maybe) create a PR ðŸ˜‚
